# Modification of CLASS (v2.9) for interacting DM-DE (phenomenological interaction)


This is a modified version of [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public), based in turn on the modified version by [Matteo Lucca](https://github.com/luccamatteo/class_iDMDE). It implements the interacting dark matter-dark energy model discussed in Costa et al 2016 (arXiv 1605.04138) with the addition of the perturbation of the Hubble parameter. The modifications with respect to the Lucca's (and original) version are in input.c, background.c and .h, and perturbations.c. The comments "BEGIN/END MODIFICATION RL" were added, where appropriate, into the previously modified version (which had "BEGIN/END MODIFICATION ML").

Installation instructions are found in the original CLASS code [wiki](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/wiki/Installation).

This code can be freely used, as long as you cite the specific release paper ([Hoerning, Landim et al 2023](add)), the modified version in ([Lucca & Hooper 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06127)) and the original CLASS release paper ([Blas et al. 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2933)).
